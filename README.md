# House of Paws

This app helps you search and gives resources for rescuing and adopting shelter dogs. You can vote for which dog our foster should pick up from the shelter to house and care for until the dog is adopted to his or her fur-ever home. There are other features like donating to other rescue group organizations and searching for adoptable dogs in your own area!

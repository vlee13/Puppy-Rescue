              <h1 className="header">Our history</h1>
              <p className="text">
                In the U.S. alone, about 3.3 million canines enter the shelters
                every YEAR. A lot of these shelters simply don't have the space
                to hold all the animals and as a result, dogs live in cramped
                cages every single day, and about 670,000 dogs are euthanized.
                <br />
                We know these facts can be daunting and it can make you question
                where to even start. That's exactly why House of Paws was
                initiated so EVERYONE can easily and actively participate in
                saving these canines, one angel baby at a time.

                Not everyone who has the heart for animal welfare has the means
                to foster or adopt. Our team at House of Paws has come up with a
                creative & easy-to-use platform where you can partner with us,
                and see that every shelter dog has a chance to find a safe &
                loving home.
                <br />
                We hand pick 10 most "unwanted" shelter dogs by selecting the
                oldest or those that have been at the shelter the longest. You
                as a member can{" "}

                up to 3 times to choose which dog gets to be rescued from the
                shelter! Every 1st of the month as long as a foster is
                available, the shelter dog with the highest votes is selected to
                go home to a foster and a warm bed. We believe fostering will
                give these dogs the best chances of getting adopted to their
                forever homes. Check out our House of Paws Alumni{" "}
